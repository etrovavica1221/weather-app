This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Weather App

This is my first React project under which I worked for two weeks practicing basics of React, function&class components and also hooks. 

## Setup

Clone my repo and open index.html. It will open a tab in your browser.
